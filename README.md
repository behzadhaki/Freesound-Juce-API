# freesound-juce


A JUCE client for accessing the [Freesound](https://freesound.org) API. From the Freesound API docs:

> With the Freesound API you can browse, search, and retrieve information about Freesound users, packs, and the sounds themselves of course. You can find similar sounds to a given target (based on content analysis) and retrieve automatically extracted features from audio files, as well as perform advanced queries combining content analysis features and other metadata (tags, etcâ€¦). With the Freesound API, you can also upload, comment, rate and bookmark sounds!

The freesound-juce client automatically maps function arguments to HTTP parameters of the Freesound API. JSON results are parsed and converted to C++ objects. The main object classes (`SoundList`, `Sound`,
`User`, `Pack`) implement utility methods to further interact with the API.

The freesound-juce client includes a simple example command line application built with JUCE v5.4.4 which shows how to use it. Client's [documentation can be found here](https://mtg.github.io/freesound-juce/index.html). However we recommend you to check the [official Freesound API documentation]((https://freesound.org/docs/api/)) to get more information about the available API endpoints and features.


## Usage

This repository is a CMake project that uses JUCE as a submodule. To build it, you need to have CMake. 

There is no need to manually download JUCE, as it is included as a git submodule. To clone the repository with the JUCE submodule, use:

## Compatibility

For now, we have only tested the latest version of the API on MacOS. We will provide windows and linux support soon as well. 


### Freesound API Key

To build the project from CMake, you need to provide your Freesound API key and client id as CMake variables.

You can request an API key at [http://freesound.org/apiv2/apply/](http://freesound.org/apiv2/apply/).

Once you have your API key and client id, you can provide them to CMake as follows:

```commandline
    -DFREESOUND_API_KEY=your_api_key -DFREESOUND_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
```


## Quick example

```cpp
FreesoundClient client(secret);
SoundList list = client.textSearch("bass");
Array<FSSound> arrayOfSearch = list.toArrayOfSounds();
for (int i = 0; i < arrayOfSearch.size(); i++) {
  name = arrayOfSearch[i].name;
  username = arrayOfSearch[i].user;
  std::cout << "Sound Name: " << name << " Username: " << username << std::endl;
}

```


## Example applications

Check out this cool example apps:

* [Demo app](https://github.com/aframires/freesound-juce/blob/master/Source/Main.cpp): simple command-line utility that makes some queries to Freesound to demonstrate how the client works. Includes OAuth2 authentication example as well.
* [FreesoundUploader](https://github.com/aframires/FreesoundUploader): let's you upload sounds to Freesound directly from your DAW!
* [FreesoundSimpleSampler](https://github.com/ffont/FreesoundSimpleSampler): let's you search in Freesound and automatically build a simple sampler based on the results.




### NOTE

The original source code from a few years ago is available at [https://github.com/mtg/freesound-juce](https://github.com/mtg/freesound-juce).

After full adaptation to the latest Freesound API and JUCE versions, the code will be moved back to the original repository.
